# Code Execution No CAN Bus Pivot

## Overview

<!--
Provide a 1-2 sentence description - see http://cveproject.github.io/docs/content/key-details-phrasing.pdf for tips

This format is a good guide:
[VULNTYPE] in [COMPONENT] in [APPLICATION] allows [ATTACKER] to [IMPACT] via [VECTOR] 
-->

The {{application}} allows malicious attacker execute code on the system by {{action}}

## Walkthrough & PoC

<!--
Provide a step-by-step walkthrough on how to access the vulnerable injection point, and how to exploit the vulnerability.
Adding a dot-pointed walkthrough with relevant screenshots will speed triage time and result in faster rewards!
-->

1. Perform reconaissance on the application by {{action}} using {{software}} on the system

1. The {{application}} exposes {{target}} on the system

1. Send {{payload}} to exposed asset

## Vulnerability Evidence

<!--
Your submission MUST include evidence of the vulnerability and not be theoretical in nature.

For an infotainment vulnerability, please include detailed instructions that can be followed to easily demonstrate and reproduce the issue. 
-->

The image below demonstrates code execution on the {{target}}.

## Demonstrated Impact

<!--
Attempt to completely stop the vehicle for functioning if the infotainment system controls mechanical aspect of the vehicle. If this is possible, provide a full proof-of-concept here.
--> 

A malicious attacker could exploit {{application}} by running commands and compromising the underlying system.
