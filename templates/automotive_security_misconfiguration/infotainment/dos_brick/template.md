# Infotainment Denial of Service (DoS/Brick)

## Overview

<!--
Provide a 1-2 sentence description - see http://cveproject.github.io/docs/content/key-details-phrasing.pdf for tips

This format is a good guide:
[VULNTYPE] in [COMPONENT] in [APPLICATION] allows [ATTACKER] to [IMPACT] via [VECTOR] 
-->

Format string attack in {{application}} of {{target}} allows malicious attacker to {{action}} <!--DoS the system-->

## Walkthrough & PoC

<!--
Provide a step-by-step walkthrough on how to access the vulnerable injection point, and how to exploit the vulnerability.
Adding a dot-pointed walkthrough with relevant screenshots will speed triage time and result in faster rewards!
-->

1. Insert ```{{payload}}``` in infotainment system input field

1. View the inserted payload from infotainment system

## Vulnerability Evidence

<!--
Your submission MUST include evidence of the vulnerability and not be theoretical in nature.

For an infotainment vulnerability, please include detailed instructions that can be followed to easily demonstrate and reproduce the issue.

## Demonstrated Impact

<!--
Attempt to completely stop the vehicle for functioning if the infotainment system controls mechanical aspect of the vehicle. If this is possible, provide a full proof-of-concept here.
--> 

A malicious attacker could brick the infotainment system and potentially the entire vehicle.
