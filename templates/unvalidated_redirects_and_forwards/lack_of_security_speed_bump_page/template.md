Security Speed Bumps are prompts used in applications that informs the user that they are being redirected to source denoted by another user.

A lack of security speed bumps can allow malicious users to spam hyperlinks and redirects causing users to navigate to malicious sites.

## Walkthrough & PoC
<!--
Provide a step-by-step walkthrough on how to access the vulnerable injection point, and how to exploit the vulnerability.
Adding a dot-pointed walkthrough with relevant screenshots will speed triage time and result in faster rewards!

Example:

1. Login to in-scope asset at <www.inscope.com/login>
1. Browse to account page
1. Modify ID token to add single quote
1. View error which states 'SQL Syntax Error'
1. Replace ID value with `1' waitfor delay '00:00:10'; `
-->

1. Navigate to endpoint: {{value}}

1. {{action}} and notice that a Security Speed Bump is not used in the application

## Vulnerability Evidence
<!--
Your submission MUST include evidence of the vulnerability and not be theoretical in nature.

For an SQL Injection vulnerability, please include specific NON-PII information discovered in the database, such as Database Version, a listing of database tables, or an injected 'sleep' payload.

You may present your evidence as output from a tool such as SQLMap, unless the program forbids the use of these tools, and it may be in the format of terminal output, screenshots, or video..

**DO NOT ACCESS PII**

## Demonstrated Impact
<!--
Demonstrating access to data other than the database version or database tables is NOT permitted without explicit permission from the program.
**DO NOT ACCESS PII**
--> 

A malicious attacker can spam comment sections or forum posts within the application with malicious links to lure users to another website for phishing and information gathering campaigns.
