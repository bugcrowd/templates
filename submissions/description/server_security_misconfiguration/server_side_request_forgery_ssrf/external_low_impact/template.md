# External Server-Side Request Forgery

## Overview of the Vulnerability:

Server-side request forgery (SSRF) is a vulnerability that exploits the trust relationship between a server and an application, or other backend systems. An attacker can take advantage of this trust to forge server-side traffic and make HTTP requests to external domains. An external SSRF vulnerability was found in this application which allows an attacker to query external services from the application.

## Business Impact:

External SSRF can lead to data theft and through an attacker accessing, deleting, or modifying data from within the application via their access to server-side systems. This could also result in reputational damage for the business through the impact to customersâ€™ trust. The severity of the impact to the business is dependent on the sensitivity of the data being stored in, and transmitted by the application.

## Steps to Reproduce:

1. Enable a HTTP interception proxy, such as Burp Suite or OWASP ZAP
1. Use a browser to login and navigate to: {{URL}}
1. Forward the following payload to the endpoint:

```HTTP
{{request}}
```

1. Observe HTTP and DNS interaction in the HTTP interception proxy
