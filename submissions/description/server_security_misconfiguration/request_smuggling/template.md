# Request Smuggling

## Overview of the Vulnerability:

HTTP request smuggling is a vulnerability that occurs due to the discrepancies between the way two or more servers interprets a sequence of requests, such as there the servers using different mechanisms to determine where the boundaries are between requests.

These misconfigurations can lead to a broad range of issues that result in an attacker bypassing security controls, taking over other user's accounts, or gaining unauthorized access to sensitive content.

## Business Impact:

Depending on the type of misconfiguration found in the server, exposure or manipulation of data from within it could lead to financial loss and reputational damage for the business.

## Steps to Reproduce:

1. Enable a HTTP intercept proxy, such as Burp Suite or OWASP ZAP, to record and intercept web traffic from your browser
1. Use a browser to navigate to: {{URL}}
1. Using the HTTP intercept proxy, alter the HTTP request header as follows: {{HTTP request}}
1. Send the request
1. Observe the response
