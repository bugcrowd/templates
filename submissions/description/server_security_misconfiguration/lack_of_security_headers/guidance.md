# Guidance

Provide a step-by-step walkthrough with a screenshot on how you exploited the vulnerability. This will speed triage time and result in faster rewards.

Your submission must include evidence of the vulnerability and not be theoretical in nature.

Attempt to escalate the vulnerability to perform additional actions. If this is possible, provide a full Proof of Concept (PoC).
