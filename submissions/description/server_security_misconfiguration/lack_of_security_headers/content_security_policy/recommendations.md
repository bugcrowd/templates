# Recommendation(s)

The `Content-Security-Policy` header should be configured in a way that reduces the attack surface of the application. The CSP header is not set as a catch-all, due to its permissive design. Therefore, It is important to ensure that the CSP heading is not too permissive for the application's needs, and has directives appropriately set.
