# Lack of Password Confirmation on Management of Multi-Factor Authentication

## Overview of the Vulnerability:

User accounts are more susceptible to account takeover when there is no password confirmation on certain actions. For example, change of email address, change of password, management of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) details, and account deletion.

The application lacks password confirmation on the management of MFA which could be abused by an attacker who has access to the userâ€™s account (eg. a public computer the user has not logged out of). From here the attacker could set up MFA for the account using an email or phone number they control.

## Business Impact:

This vulnerability can lead to reputational damage and indirect financial loss to the company as customers may view the application as insecure.

## Steps to Reproduce:

1. Enable a HTTP interception proxy, such as Burp Suite or OWASP ZAP
1. Use a browser to navigate to: {{URL}}
1. Set up MFA
1. Intercept the request in a Web Proxy
1. Adjust and forward the following request to the endpoint:

```HTTP
{{request}}
```

1. Observe that no password confirmation is required

## Proof of Concept (PoC):

The screenshot(s) below demonstrates the lack of password confirmation when setting up MFA:
