# Recommendations

It is recommended that only strong cipher suites are supported. As a guideline, the following cipher suites are recommended:

- Ciphers such as EXDHE and DHE, which use perfect forward secrecy key exchange.
- Ciphers that use SHA256
- AES-GCM is preferred for authentication ciphers. These are only available when TLS1.2 and TLS1.3 are in use.
