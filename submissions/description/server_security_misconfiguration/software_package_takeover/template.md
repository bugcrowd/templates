Software package takeover is where an attacker is able to gain control of software packages or dependencies used by an application by hijacking ownership or exploiting weak security controls in package repositories. This control allows the attacker to modify the package, potentially injecting malicious code or making other unauthorized changes. This can in turn have downstream affects on the web application.

## Business Impact

This vulnerability can lead to the injection of malicious code, unauthorized access, or compromise of the application and its data. It can also result in reputational damage, financial losses, and legal liabilities. The severity of the impact to the business is dependent on the nature of the compromised package, its use within the application, and the attacker's ability to modify or inject code.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Use a browser to navigate to: {{URL}}
2. Identify the software packages or dependencies used by the application.
3. Observe that the software package has outdated dependencies or unmaintained packages.
4. Demonstrate the ability to inject malicious code or take over the package.
5. Observe the following downstream affects on the target application:
