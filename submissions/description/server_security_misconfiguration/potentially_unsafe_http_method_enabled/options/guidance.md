<!--
Provide a step-by-step walkthrough on how to access the vulnerable injection point, and how to exploit the vulnerability.
Adding a dot-pointed walkthrough with relevant screenshots will speed triage time and result in faster rewards!

Example:

1. Browse to the URL <https://data1.inscope.com/datastore1/dataviewer?data=regulardata/>
1. Now change the URL from `data=regulardata` to `data=%2e%2e%2fsecuredata%2f` which is URL Encoded from `../securedata/`
1. You will now see we can view to a new directory that was not intended to be viewed using path traversal 

-->
<!--
Your submission MUST include evidence of the vulnerability and not be theoretical in nature.

Attaching a screenshot of the webpage with the URL bar in view will be sufficient for this report.
-->

<!--
This path traversal vulnerability allows an attack to gain acces to a folder called `securedata` in a directory it was not intended to access.
