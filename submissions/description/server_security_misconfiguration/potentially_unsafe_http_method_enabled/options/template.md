# Potentially Unsafe OPTIONS HTTP Method Enabled

## Overview of the Vulnerability

HTTP request methods are used to indicate the desired action to be performed in communications between a client and a server. For example, an endpoint will return a list of all methods allowed when sent a request using the OPTIONS method.

The OPTIONS HTTP method can be sent to this application and could be used by an attacker to gather information or interact with an endpoint in a way that is unintended, gathering information about the system for further attacks.

## Business Impact

HTTP methods enabled can lead to reputational damage for the business through the impact to customersâ€™ trust in the security of the application.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Enable a HTTP intercept proxy, such as Burp Suite or OWASP ZAP
1. Use a browser to login and navigate to: {{URL}}
1. Within the HTTP intercept proxy insert the following request:

1. Observe the change of the HTTP method to the OPTIONS method
1. Forward the new request to the application

## Proof of Concept (PoC)

The screenshot below demonstrates the HTTP method enabled:
