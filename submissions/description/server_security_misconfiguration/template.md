# Server Security Misconfiguration

## Overview of the Vulnerability:

Server security misconfigurations result from errors in the setup and deployment of a web server. These misconfigurations can lead to a broad range of issues which could allow a malicious attacker to manipulate the server and retrieve, change, or delete content.

## Business Impact:

Depending on the type of misconfiguration found in the server, exposure or manipulation of data from within it could lead to financial loss and reputational damage for the business.

## Steps to Reproduce:

1. Enable a HTTP intercept proxy, such as Burp Suite or OWASP ZAP, to record and intercept web traffic from your browser
1. Use a browser to navigate to: {{URL}}
1. Using the HTTP intercept proxy, capture the response
1. Observe the server security misconfiguration
