# Mail Server Misconfiguration

## Overview of the Vulnerability:

A Sender Policy Framework (SPF) and DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM) are security controls used by email domains to prevent spoofing. A missing or misconfigured SPF or DKIM on a domain enables an attacker to spoof the name of a domain and send emails on its behalf. The misconfiguration on this mail server allows an attacker to use a trusted domain for email spoofing, commonly used in phishing and spam campaigns to appear as if the emails originate from a legitimate source.

## Business Impact:

Depending on the type of misconfiguration found in the mail server, an attacker who is able to  manipulate and use the domain as part of a phishing or spam campaign can cause reputational damage to the business.

## Steps to Reproduce:

1. Using the following command to verify the target is a domain without an MX record:

{{value}}

1. Use dig or nslookup to request details for DMARC:

{{value}}

1. Send a test email using the following application:

{{application}}
