# Cache Poisoning

## Overview of the Vulnerability:

A web cache allows for static and fast fetching of content in web applications. Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) are commonly used to serve content used by applications. A malicious attacker can take advantage of caching mechanisms to serve content or deny service to certain applications using X-Based Host headers (X-Forwarded-Host, etc.).

Cache poisoning allows an attacker to serve content for cached pages on CDNs and websites with cache misconfigurations. This opens the application up to attacks like Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF), and to leakage of sensitive information.

## Business Impact:

This vulnerability can lead to reputational damage and indirect financial loss to the company through the impact to customersâ€™ trust.

## Steps to Reproduce:

1. Enable a HTTP interception proxy, such as Burp Suite or OWASP ZAP
1. Use a browser to navigate to the following url: {{URL}}
1. Intercept the request in the HTTP interception Proxy and change HTTP header: {{value}} to {{value}}
1. Forward the following request to the endpoint:

```HTTP
{{request}}
```

1. Notice that the following page is cached
