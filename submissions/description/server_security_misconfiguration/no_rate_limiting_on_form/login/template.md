# No Rate Limiting on Login Form

## Overview of the Vulnerability:

Rate Limiting prevents an application from becoming unresponsive or unavailable due to too many requests exhausting the application's resources. A lack of rate limiting on a login form allows an attacker to send a number of requests to the server which will attempt to authenticate a user with the supplied credentials, even if they are invalid. This has the risk of an attacker being able to attempt to bruteforce credentials for users without any protections, and can be used as a method of credential stuffing and compromising accounts to the service.

## Business Impact:

No rate limiting on a login form can result in reputational damage to the organization if an attacker successfully takes over an account through a bruteforce login attempt. It also has the potential to cause accelerated service usage, which can incur a direct financial cost in environments with SaaS services or pay on demand systems.

## Steps to Reproduce:

1. Enable a HTTP intercept proxy, such as Burp Suite or OWASP ZAP, to record and intercept web traffic from your browser
1. Using a browser, navigate to {{url}}
1. Fill out the form with incorrect credentials
1. Submit the login form while using the HTTP intercept proxy to intercept the request
1. Using the HTTP intercept proxy, re-issue the captured request 400 times in rapid succession
1. Observe within the HTTP intercept proxy that all 400 of these requests generate successful login attempts, showing that there is no rate-limiting on the form
1. Login with valid account credentials
1. Observe that a valid login is successful which shows that there is no silent lockout implemented
