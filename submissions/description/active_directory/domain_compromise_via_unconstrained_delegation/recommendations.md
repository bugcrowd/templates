Disable Unconstrained Delegation on the affected system/account. Where delegation is strictly necessary, consider migrating more restrictive delegation types (such as Resource-Based Constrained Delegation (RBCD)). 

Ensure that highly privileged accounts are protected from delegation by enabling the "Account is sensitive and cannot be delegated" option in Active Directory.
