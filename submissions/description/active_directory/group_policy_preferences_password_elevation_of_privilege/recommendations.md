Install the KB2962486 patch on all affected systems to prevent new credentials from being placed in Group Policy Preferences. As this patch will not fix existing Group Policy Preference files, refer to the vendor security bulletin MS14-025, where Microsoft has provided a PowerShell script to detect existing stored passwords for removal.
