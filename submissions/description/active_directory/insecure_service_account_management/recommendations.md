Ensure that service accounts follow the principle of least privilege such that only the minimum permissions necessary to perform their required functions are granted, thereby limiting their potential for misuse if compromised. A strong password policy should also be enforced, ensuring that all service account passwords are long, complex, and unique.

For a more robust and sustainable solution, organizations should consider transitioning to the use of Managed Service Accounts (MSAs) or Group Managed Service Accounts (gMSAs) wherever possible. These accounts offer automatic password management and rotation, in turn reducing administrative burden and preventing the risk of using weak or reused passwords.
