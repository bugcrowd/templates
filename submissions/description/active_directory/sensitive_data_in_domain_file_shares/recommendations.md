Conduct a thorough audit to identify, review and restrict access to all sensitive network file shares based on the principle of least privilege to ensure that only authorized individuals or groups with a legitimate business need have access to sensitive data. The practice of storing plaintext credentials within files should be avoided and replaced with secure credential management solutions (e.g., password vaults, secrets management systems).
Furthermore, consider educating employees on data handling policies, the importance of protecting sensitive information, and the risks associated with unauthorized access.
