The Active Directory (AD) domain had a large number of user accounts belonging to the highly privileged “Domain Admins” security group. 

The "Domain Admins" group possesses the highest level of administrative authority within an Active Directory domain, granting full control over all domain controllers, workstations, servers, and every object in the domain.

Having an excessive number of Domain Admins (DA) enlarges the attack surface by presenting a broad range of high-value targets, in turn increasing the likelihood of domain compromise.

**Business Risk**

Having an excessive number of highly privileged accounts in the domain expands the attack surface and increases the risk of an attacker compromising the domain. In turn, this could allow unauthorized access, data theft, and malicious activities. Such incidents can result in financial losses, damage to the organization's reputation, and erosion of customer trust, especially if sensitive customer information is compromised.
