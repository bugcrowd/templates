The Domain Administrators group should contain only accounts that strictly require such authority to complete their roles. The accounts themselves should be used infrequently, so as to further reduce the chance of compromise. 

Ensure that regular auditing of security group membership and user access rights is undertaken to prevent unnecessary permissions from being granted to user accounts.
