Apply the Microsoft security updates addressing CVE-2019-1040 and CVE-2019-1166 to the affected system. These patches modify how the server validates the MIC, preventing the bypass.

Additionally, for comprehensive protection across the domain, consider enforcing signing requirements on all servers where possible.
