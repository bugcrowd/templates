The server was vulnerable to a NT LAN Manager (NTLM) tampering vulnerability referred to as “Drop the Mic”, which allows Message Integrity Code (MIC) protections to be bypassed. 

The MIC is a cryptographic checksum designed to provide integrity protection for the NTLM authentication exchange. It serves as a protection mechanism against attempts to downgrade security features such as session signing which are negotiated during the exchange.

Drop the Mic (CVE-2019-1040) and Drop the Mic 2 (CVE-2019-1166) are vulnerabilities which allow the protections provided by the MIC to be circumvented, in turn permitting the attacker to overcome session signing negotiation. As a result, affected servers which do not enforce session signing become vulnerable to NTLM relay attacks. In an NTLM relay attack, an attacker intercepts an NTLM authentication attempt from a client and "relays" it to the targeted server in order to perform actions with the privileges of the impersonated user.

**Business Risk**

This vulnerability could allow an unauthenticated attacker to gain a foothold on the domain or pursue lateral movement vectors using NTLM relay attack(s). In turn, this could allow unauthorized access, data theft, and malicious activities. Such incidents can result in financial losses, damage to the organization's reputation, and erosion of customer trust, especially if sensitive customer information is compromised.
