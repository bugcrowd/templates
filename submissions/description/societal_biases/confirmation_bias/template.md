Confirmation bias occurs when AI algorithms selectively process information that confirms pre-existing beliefs, assumptions, or hypotheses, while disregarding contrary evidence. Outputs from AI models that have a confirmation bias can result in misinformed choices, or the reinforcement of existing stereotypes and misconceptions.

## Business Impact

Confirmation bias in this AI model can result in reputational damage and indirect monetary loss due to the loss of customer trust in the output of the model.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Feed the AI model with data that includes information supporting a pre-existing bias.
1. Observe the model's responses and decisions, noting its preference for data that confirms the bias.
1. Present the model with contrary evidence and observe whether it dismisses or downplays it.
