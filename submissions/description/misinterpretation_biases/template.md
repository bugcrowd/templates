Misinterpretation biases can occur when AI models incorrectly interpret the context or data, leading the model to make inaccurate decisions or predictions. These misinterpretation biases can stem from inadequate training data, or limitations in the model's design, resulting in outputs that to do not align with the context of the inputs.

**Business Impact**

Misinterpretation biases in this AI model can result in reputational damage and indirect monetary loss due to the loss of customer trust in the output of the model.

**Steps to Reproduce**

1. Present the AI model with scenarios where it needs to consider broader context.
1. Observe the model's decisions and its inability to account for the context in its choices.
