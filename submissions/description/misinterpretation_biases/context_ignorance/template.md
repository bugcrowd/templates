Context ignorance occurs when AI models do not consider the broader context when making decisions, leading to uninformed or unfair decision making. This can be a result of the AI model's design or the training data it has been trained on. Outputs from AI models that have context ignorance can result in discrimination, reinforcement of stereotypes, or viewpoints that disadvantage certain groups.

## Business Impact

Context ignorance in this AI model can result in a lack of fairness and objectivity which can lead to reputational damage and a loss of customer trust in the output of the model. Additionally, business decisions that rely on this AI model are also affected due to suboptimal outcomes and missed opportunities.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Present the AI model with scenarios where it needs to consider broader context.
1. Observe the model's decisions and its inability to account for the context in its choices.
