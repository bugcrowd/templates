When Operating System (OS) firmware is insecure, it broadens the application’s attack surface and gives  an attacker more opportunity to maintain persistence and achieve a high level of privilege within the application. Firmware can be exploited via network, software, or hardware layers. Once compromised, an attacker can establish persistence, capture sensitive data, exfiltrate data, impact application performance, or pivot into attacking the company’s wider network.

## Business Impact

This vulnerability can lead to direct financial loss to the company due to data theft, application manipulation and corruption, or denial of service to customers and users of the application. It can also lead to reputational damage as customers may view the application as insecure.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Start {{application}} on the operating system and navigate to {{url}}
1. Input the following payload into {{parameter}}:

{{Payload}}

1. Observe that the OS firmware is insecure
