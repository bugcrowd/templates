# Poorly Configured Operating System Security

## Overview of the Vulnerability

The device employs a standard operating system where the configuration fails to adequately secure the device. This poor configuration can expose the device to various security vulnerabilities, making it susceptible to unauthorized access, data breaches, and other malicious activities. An attacker with access to the operating system can gain access to the applications and data on the device.

## Business Impact

The inadequate security configuration of the operating system can lead to significant risks, including the compromise of sensitive information, operational disruptions, and financial losses. Moreover, it can damage the organization's reputation and customer trust. Ensuring compliance with security standards and regulatory requirements becomes challenging under these conditions, potentially resulting in legal and financial repercussions.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Power on the device and login, then open the settings menu.
2. You'll see issues which deviate from hardening recommendations, including unnecessary services running, default passwords unchanged, or insufficient access controls.
