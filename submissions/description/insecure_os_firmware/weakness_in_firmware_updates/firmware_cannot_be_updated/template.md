The hardware lacks the capability for firmware updates, leaving the system exposed to unpatched vulnerabilities and security risks. These limitations prevents effective maintenance and security management, rendering the device obsolete against evolving threats. An attacker can leverage the lack of firmware updates to gain access to sensitive information.

## Business Impact

Inability to perform firmware updates directly affects operational resilience and security posture, leading to potential system integrity and reliability issues. It elevates the risk of operational disruptions and could necessitate increased expenditures for device replacement or additional security measures.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Identify the specific {{Hardware}} model:
{{Hardware name and model number}}
2. Check the user interface or official documentation for firmware update options.
3. Verify the lack of an update mechanism by attempting to locate or execute a firmware update process within the device's settings or configuration portal.
