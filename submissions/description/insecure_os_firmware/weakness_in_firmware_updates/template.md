There is a weakness in firmware updates that leaves the system exposed to unpatched vulnerabilities and security risks. These limitations prevents effective maintenance and security management, rendering the device obsolete against evolving threats. An attacker can leverage the weakness in firmware updates to gain access to sensitive information.

## Business Impact

Weaknesses in firmware updates directly affects operational resilience and security posture, leading to potential system integrity and reliability issues. It can lead to unauthorized access and data breaches, compromising the integrity of the device. The subsequent detection and exploitation of these vulnerabilities can cause significant financial, operational, and reputational damage to the organization, diminishing customer trust and potentially violating regulatory compliance.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Identify the specific {{Hardware}} model:
{{Hardware name and model number}}
2. Check the user interface or official documentation for firmware update options.
3. Verify the weakness in the firmware update process within the device's settings or configuration portal.
