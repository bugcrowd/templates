The hardware fails to validate the authenticity and integrity of the update file. Without proper validation, the system is susceptible to accepting and installing corrupted or malicious updates, compromising the device's security and functionality.

## Business Impact

The direct impact includes potential compromise of device functionality, unauthorized access to sensitive data, and the introduction of malware, leading to operational disruptions. This vulnerability undermines the trust in the device's security measures, potentially resulting in significant financial costs for mitigation and recovery, alongside damaging the organization's reputation for safeguarding user data and system integrity.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Prepare a modified or corrupted firmware update file for the {{hardware version}}.
2. Initiate the firmware update process using the compromised file.
3. Observe the lack of validation checks for the update's authenticity or integrity during the update process.
