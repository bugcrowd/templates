The firmware used for the hardware is stored or transmitted without encryption. This lack of encryption allows for easier reverse engineering and analysis, enabling unauthorized individuals to more readily identify security vulnerabilities within the device's firmware.

## Business Impact

The absence of encryption on the firmware heightens the risk of security vulnerabilities being discovered and exploited. This can lead to unauthorized access and data breaches, compromising the integrity of the device. The subsequent detection and exploitation of these vulnerabilities can cause significant financial, operational, and reputational damage to the organization, diminishing customer trust and potentially violating regulatory compliance.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Browse to the following URL and download the firmware: {{URL}}
2. Open the firmware file using {{Tool}} and {{techniques}}, due to its unencrypted state.
3. Observe that the firmware appears unencrypted, simplifying the process for reverse engineering and vulnerability identification.
