A kiosk escape or breakout occurs when an exploit allows users to bypass the software package serving as the frontend for an application on a system, gaining unauthorized access to the underlying operating system. This vulnerability varies in impact depending on the operating system and the level of hardening applied to the system. In cases where the system uses administrator-level access, the consequences can include defacement, installation of malicious software, or breaches of data integrity, potentially affecting stored customer data.

## Business Impact

This vulnerability can lead to unauthorized access, data breaches, and malicious activities, including the installation of unwanted software and alteration of stored data. Such incidents can result in significant financial losses, damage to the organization's reputation, and erosion of customer trust, especially if sensitive customer information is compromised.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Turn the {{hardware}} on and wait for the software to run.
1. Constantly click on the bottom right of the touch screen, revealing the desktop.
1. Observe that there is an administrator level user on the device.

## Proof of Concept (PoC)

The following screenshots demonstrate the process of escaping from the application's controlled environment to access the underlying operating system. This may include screenshots or a description of the exploit technique used, the access gained to system settings or files, and any unauthorized actions performed as a result:
