When the password policy for an application is weak, the strength of the overall authentication process for the application is diminished. Not having complexity requirements for passwords, password history checks, or enforcing account lockouts, all weaken the password policy. This application’s weak password policy decreases the time it takes an attacker to successfully guess account passwords through manual or automated processes. This can lead to account take over for accounts with weak passwords set.

#### Business Impact

Having a weak password policy can result in reputational damage for the business through the impact to customers’ trust as they could believe that the business doesn’t take their account security seriously or trust that their data within will remain secure.

#### Steps to Reproduce

1. Use a browser to navigate to: {{URL}}
1. Attempt to login
1. Observe that the application allows the use of weak passwords

#### Proof of Concept (PoC)
