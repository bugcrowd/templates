# Recommendation(s)

It is best practice to invalidate the password reset token after after a user successfully resets their password and logs into the application. Overall, the password reset implementation should conform to the following guidelines:

- A secure password policy should be in place for the user to create a strong new password
- Password reset tokens should be long to protect against brute force guessing attacks, linked to an individual, invalidated after use, and have a short expiry time
- Passwords should be stored and transmitted securely
- Once a userâ€™s password has been reset, they should be prompted to login in again through the usual login portal and not automatically signed in
