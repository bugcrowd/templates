# Weak 2FA Implementation

## Overview of the Vulnerability:

Two Factor Authentication (2FA) adds an extra layer of security to user accounts by prompting them to enter a uniquely generated one-time password (OTP) after they have successfully inputted their username and password. The applicationâ€™s implementation of 2FA is weak which makes user accounts more susceptible to compromise. An attacker can take advantage of this weak 2FA implementation and potentially take over user accounts.

## Business Impact:

This vulnerability can lead to reputational damage and indirect financial loss to the company as customers may view the application as insecure.

## Steps to Reproduce:

1. Login to the application at: {{url}}
1. When the two factor authentication step of the login is reached, request a code
1. Perform {{action}} and observe that the 2FA implementation is weak

## Proof of Concept (PoC):

The screenshot(s) below demonstrates the weak implementation of 2FA:
