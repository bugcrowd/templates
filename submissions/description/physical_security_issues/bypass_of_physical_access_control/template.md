The physical access control mechanisms implemented to secure the device are vulnerable to a bypass attack. This flaw allows unauthorized attacker to circumvent the designed physical security measures implemented, gaining access to the device's internal hardware and components that are intended to be restricted.

## Business Impact

The ability to bypass physical access controls undermines the overall security of the device, exposing it to risks of tampering, data extraction, or the insertion of malicious components. Such breaches can lead to compromised device integrity, unauthorized access to sensitive information, and potential operational failures. The resulting damage can extend to financial losses, erosion of customer trust, and reputational harm, especially if the compromise leads to broader security incidents.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Walk up to the front of the {{hardware}}, and notice the lock currently in place to prevent access to the machine.
2. Walk to the opposite side, and you'll notice a vent grill attached with phillips head screws.
3. Using a philips #1 screwdriver, unscrew the vent grill and pull it off the device.
4. You now have bypassed the access control and gained access to the device's internal components.
