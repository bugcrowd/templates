A weakness has been identified in the physical access controls deployed to secure physical access to facilities, premises, or sensitive areas within an organization. This scenario typically arises from insufficient security measures, such as weak locks, ineffective surveillance, or lack of employee awareness. This vulnerability can result in unauthorized individuals could easily obtain a key to gain access.

## Business Impact

The perceived ease of bypassing such a security measure can damage an organization's reputation, lead to financial losses, and erode customer trust, especially if sensitive information or valuable assets are compromised.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Looking at the facility, it is possible to identify indications of physical access: {{indicators}}
1. Perform {{action}} to bypass {{security measure}}
