Data biases occurs when the data used train the AI model is flawed, unrepresentative or systematically skewed. Biases can stem from different sources, such as sampling errors, historical prejudices, or a lack of diversity in the dataset. Outputs from AI models that have a data bias can result in inaccurate, unfair, or otherwise discriminatory predictions or decisions.

#### Business Impact

Data biases in this AI model can result in reputational damage and indirect monetary loss due to the loss of customer trust in the output of the model.

#### Steps to Reproduce

1. Input the following text into the model. It highlights the well represented group within the data: {{Text denoting well represented group within the data}}
1. Input the following text into the model. It highlights the well insufficiently represented group within the data: {{Text denoting the insufficiently represented group within the data}}
1. Note that the output of the AI model classifies these two groups disparately, showing a bias in the data.
