Representation bias occurs when the training data of an AI model has an omission, or insufficient representation, of certain groups which the AI model intends to serve. Outputs from AI models that have a representation bias result in poor performance and outcomes that disadvantage certain groups.

## Business Impact

Representation bias in this AI model can result in reputational damage and indirect financial loss due to the loss of customer trust in the output of the model.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Input the following text into the model. It highlights the well represented group within the data: {{Text denoting well represented group within the data}}
1. Input the following text into the model. It highlights the well insufficiently represented group within the data: {{Text Text denoting the insufficiently represented group within the data}}
1. Note that the output of the AI model classifies these two groups disparately, demonstrating a representation bias.
