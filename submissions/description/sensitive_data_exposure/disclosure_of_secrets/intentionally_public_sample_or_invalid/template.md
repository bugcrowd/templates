# Disclosure of Secrets for an Invalid or Intentionally Publicly Sample

## Overview of the Vulnerability:

Disclosure of critically sensitive data occurs when the data is not properly secured, allowing critically sensitive data, such as secrets, API keys, or other data critical to business operation to be exposed. This application discloses an invalid, or intentionally public sample, of secrets that are used for the application. While seemingly harmless, an attacker can use these examples to build wordlists, which can be used to bruteforce requests to the application until a valid secret is processed successfully.

## Business Impact:

Disclosure of secrets can lead to indirect financial loss through an attacker accessing, deleting, or modifying data from within the application via the access gained using the non-corporate user account. This could also result in reputational damage for the business through the impact to customersâ€™ trust. The severity of the impact to the business is dependent on the sensitivity of the data being stored in, and transmitted by the application.
