# Disclosure of Secrets

## Overview of the Vulnerability:

Disclosure of secrets occurs when sensitive data is not behind an authorization barrier. When this information is exposed it can place sensitive data, such as secrets, at risk. This can occur due to a variety of scenarios such as not encrypting data, secrets committed to GitHub within public repositories, or exposed internal assets.

Examples of secret data include, but are not limited to, vendor details, client information, Personally Identifiable Information (PII), Social Security Numbers, medical data, banking information, and credentials or authentication keys. Disclosure of secrets could be used by an attacker to sell access to databases and database content, or use credentials identified to take over accounts, amongst other attack vectors.

## Business Impact:

Disclosure of secrets can lead to indirect financial loss through an attacker accessing, deleting, or modifying data from within the application. This could also result in reputational damage for the business through the impact to customersâ€™ trust. The severity of the impact to the business is dependent on the sensitivity of the data being stored in, and transmitted by the application.
