# Large Language Model (LLM) Output Handling

## Overview of the Vulnerability

Insecure output handling within Large Language Models (LLMs) occurs when the output generated by the LLM is not sanitized or validated before being passed downstream to other systems. This can allow an attacker to indirectly gain access to systems, elevate their privileges, or gain arbitrary code execution by using crafted prompts.

## Business Impact

This vulnerability can lead to reputational and financial damage of the company due an attacker gaining access to unauthorized data or compromising the decision-making of the LLM, which would also impact customers' trust. The severity of the impact to the business is dependent on the sensitivity of the accessible data being transmitted by the application.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Navigate to the following URL:
1. Inject the following prompt into the LLM:

```prompt
  {malicious prompt}
```

1. Observe that the LLM returns sensitive data
