# Radio Frequency Unauthorized Access To Turn On Vehicle

## Overview of the Vulnerability:

The Radio Frequency Hub (RFH) is a receiver hub which communicates with other electronic devices and control units through either the Controller Area Network (CAN) bus or a separate serial bus. The RFH allows communications for vehicle accessories such as remote ignition systems, keyless entry, remote immobilization systems, and anti-theft systems, amongst other operations.

Misconfigurations in the RFH can lead to security weaknesses across any of these systems. An attacker can control the power state of a device via radio frequency. They could exploit this by performing a Denial of Service (DoS) attack, preventing the owner of the vehicle from turning their vehicle on or off, as well as allowing for remote control of the vehicle during use.

## Business Impact:

This RFH misconfiguration can result in reputational damage and indirect financial loss for the business through the impact to customersâ€™ trust in the security and safety of the automotive vehicle.

## Steps to Reproduce:

1. Setup {{hardware}} and {{software}} to interact with the RF layer of {{target}}
1. Turn on {{target}} using {{hardware}} and/or {{software}}
