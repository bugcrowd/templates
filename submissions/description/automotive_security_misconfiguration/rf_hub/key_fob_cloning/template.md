# Radio Frequency Key Fob Cloning

## Overview of the Vulnerability:

The Radio Frequency Hub (RFH) is a receiver hub which communicates with other electronic devices and control units through either the Controller Area Network (CAN) bus or a separate serial bus. The RFH allows communications for vehicle accessories such as remote ignition systems, keyless entry, remote immobilization systems, and anti-theft systems, amongst other operations.

Misconfigurations in the RFH can lead to security weaknesses across any of these systems. An attacker can exploit the target system by creating a permanent clone of the key fob, giving permanent access to any vehicle of the same make/model.

## Business Impact:

This RFH misconfiguration can result in reputational damage and indirect financial loss for the business through the impact to customersâ€™ trust in the security and safety of the automotive vehicle.

## Steps to Reproduce:

1. Setup {{hardware}} and {{software}} to interact with the RF layer of {{target}}
1. Use the {{application}} on {{target}} to clone key fob by {{action}}
1. Use the original key fob to roll the nonce, then unlock {{target}} using spoofed {{hardware}}
