# Infotainment Code Execution CAN Bus Pivot

## Overview of the Vulnerability:

The In-Vehicle Infotainment (IVI) system, is a central unit in an automotive vehicle's dashboard that centralizes information and entertainment systems and their controls. Misconfigurations in the IVI system can lead to security weaknesses. An attacker can pivot into the CAN bus system and execute code by taking advantage of an IVI misconfiguration, causing the system to not behave as intended.

## Business Impact:

This IVI system misconfiguration can result in reputational damage and indirect financial loss for the business through the impact to customersâ€™ trust in the security and safety of the automotive vehicle.

## Steps to Reproduce:

1. The IVI system {{application}} uses this feature to {{action}}, exploited by {{action}}
1. Pivot into the CAN bus using this vulnerability by {{action}}
1. Inject the following CAN bus payload by using {{hardware}} and/or {{application}}:

{{payload}}

1. Observe that {{action}} occurs as a result

## Proof of Concept (PoC):

The image(s) below demonstrates the process by which an attacker identifies where the IVI system communication occurs. It also shows how an attacker connects to the CAN bus, and is able to inject the payload(s):
