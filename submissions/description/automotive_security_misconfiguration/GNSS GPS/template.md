# GNSS/GPS Spoofing

## Overview of the Vulnerability:

Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) and Global Positioning System (GPS) spoofing involves the broadcast of fake GNSS/GPS signals to fake the position of a vehicle, or otherwise make the positioning unreliable. An attacker is able to send fake GNSS/GPS signals to the receiver and successfully spoof a vehicle’s position.

## Business Impact:

This vulnerability can result in reputational damage and indirect financial loss for the business through the impact to customers’ trust in the security and safety of the automotive vehicle.

## Steps to Reproduce:

1. The GNSS/GPS signal is identified by using {{hardware}} on {{target}}
1. Connect to {{target}} by using {{application}} with {{hardware}}
1. Inject the following payload using {{hardware}}:

{{payload}}

1. Observe that the GNSS/GPS signal has been spoofed

## Proof of Concept (PoC):

The image(s) below demonstrates the process by which an attacker identifies where the GNSS/GPS communication occurs. It also shows how an attacker connects to the {{target}}, and is able to inject the payload(s), causing GNSS/GPS spoofing:
