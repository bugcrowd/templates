Automotive security misconfigurations can occur within the software, firmware, or network settings of vehicles, leading to security vulnerabilities. These misconfigurations can stem from default settings, inadequate security measures, or improper configurations during the manufacturing or maintenance processes. An attacker can exploit this misconfiguration and gain unauthorised access to data, or manipulate the vehicle system's integrity.

## Business Impact

This vulnerability can lead to data breaches, unauthorized access to sensitive information, remote exploitation or manipulation of vehicle systems, or compromise of driver safety, privacy, and vehicle integrity. Additionally, it may result in reputational damage, legal liabilities, and financial losses for automotive manufacturers and service providers.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Identify the software, firmware, and network components present in the vehicle:
{{Vulnerable component}}
2. Analyze the configurations and settings of these components for potential misconfigurations.
3. Exploit the misconfiguration to gain unauthorized access, manipulate vehicle systems, or intercept communications.
4. Observe that it is possible to {{vulnerable action}}, demonstrating the misconfiguration.
