A Computer Automated Public Turing Test test to tell Computers and Humans Apart (CAPTCHA) allows applications to tell whether a user is a human or a robot. A CAPTCHA can be bypassed when the implementation or its workflow is improperly configured, or when software can be used to bypass the challenge.

An attacker can bypass the CAPTCHA form and spam the website with queries for registration, login, as well as spam support teams with faulty requests.

#### Business Impact

CAPTCHA bypass can lead to reputational damage for the business due to a loss in confidence and trust by users. It can also result in indirect financial loss to the business through the extra workloads placed on internal teams to deal with spam from an attacker.

#### Steps to Reproduce

1. Navigate to the following endpoint with CAPTCHA: {{value}}
1. Use {{software}} to bypass CAPTCHA

#### Proof of Concept (PoC)
