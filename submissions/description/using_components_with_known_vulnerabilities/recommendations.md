# Recommendation(s)

All software should be kept up to date and routinely managed through a patch management process. It is important to have an inventory of all software and versions in use, including dependencies.

Regular monitoring of the Common Vulnerability and Exposures (CVE) and National Vulnerability Database (NVD) is also recommended.
