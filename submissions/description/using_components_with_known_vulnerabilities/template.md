# Using Components with Known Vulnerabilities

## Overview of the Vulnerability:

Outdated software is common in applications that use many types of different software stacks. Many outdated software versions have well known and documented vulnerabilities, including those with Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) IDs. An attacker can take advantage of old software versions in this application by using open source vulnerability information and CVEs to exploit the application.

## Business Impact:

Outdated Software Version can lead to reputational damage for the business due to a loss in confidence and trust by users.

## Steps to Reproduce:

1. Enable a HTTP interception proxy, such as Burp Suite or OWASP ZAP
1. Use a browser to navigate to: {{URL}}
1. Intercept a response with the HTTP interception proxy
1. Observe the outdated software version:

```HTTP
{{response}}
```
