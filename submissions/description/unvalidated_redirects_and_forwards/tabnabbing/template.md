Tabnabbing is a type of phishing attack that tricks users into inputting their login and password to a carbon copy of a genuine website. An attacker can use dynamic javascript to change the origin of a website to another website that looks exactly the same as the original, and can phish information from them.

## Business Impact

Tabnabbing can result in reputational damage for the business as customers' trust is negatively impacted by an attacker sending them to a phishing site to extract login credentials, or coercing them to send a financial transaction.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Using a browser, navigate to: {{URL}}
1. {{action}} to navigate the user to a website in another window or tab
1. {{action}} to change the original website to a malicious website: {{value}}
