# Plaintext Password Field

## Overview of the Vulnerability:

The password field for the login form of the application reveals the password in plaintext. An attacker with local access can shoulder surf or otherwise tailgate a user and watch them login to the application. From here, an attacker could login as a user to impersonate them or make requests on their behalf.

## Business Impact:

This vulnerability can lead to reputational damage and indirect financial loss to the company through the impact to customersâ€™ trust.

## Steps to Reproduce:

1. Use a browser to navigate to: {{URL}}
1. Enter text within the password field
1. Use the `Inspect` tool to see that the input is shown in plaintext
