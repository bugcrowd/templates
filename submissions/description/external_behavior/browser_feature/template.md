Browsers implement features to offer users both online and offline features to enhance the user experience of the browser and applications. For example, a browser can offer offline features such as caching, notifications, as well as offloading computation for applications, such as Progressive Web Applications (PWA). Occasionally, these browser features can cause security issues depending on their implementation. A local attacker can take advantage of the browser feature to impersonate a user and make requests on their behalf.
