# Flash-Based Cross-Site Request Forgery (High Impact)

## Overview of the Vulnerability:

Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) occurs when requests to the application are submitted on behalf of an authenticated user without their knowledge via crafted, malicious code which can be in the form of a link the user clicks. The application is unable to distinguish between the malicious request and a legitimate request from the user.

A high impact flash-based CSRF is possible for this application allowing an attacker to submit requests to the application on behalf of an authenticated privileged user. An attacker is able to perform the actions of a privileged user through their account. This could include modifying, adding, or removing data from the application. Additionally, the attacker needs to socially engineer the user to click on a link, or paste the malicious code into the user’s browser. If successful, the code will execute within that user’s browser in the context of this domain.

## Business Impact:

High impact CSRF could lead to data modification or theft leading to indirect financial impact to the business. An attacker is also able to interact with other users, including performing other malicious attacks which would appear to originate from a legitimate privileged user. These malicious actions could result in reputational damage for the business through the impact to customers’ trust.

## Steps to Reproduce:

1. Enable a HTTP interception proxy, such as Burp Suite or OWASP ZAP
1. Modify the request with the following CSRF POC code which uses a `.SWF` file:

```HTML
{{CSRF POC}}
```

 and forward the request to the endpoint:

```HTTP
{{request}}
```

1. Navigate to the following URL and observe within the HTTP interception proxy that the action taken by the CSRF POC code was successful: {{URL}}
