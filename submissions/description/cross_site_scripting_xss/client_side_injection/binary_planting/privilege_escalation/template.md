# Client-Side Injection via Binary Planting (Default Folder Privilege Escalation)

## Overview of the Vulnerability:

Client-side injection via binary planting is a vulnerability that results from client-side untrusted data, in the form of a binary file, being interpreted and executed by the system. Within the application an attacker is able to load a planted binary file on a local or remote file system, which is then loaded and executed by the application. As a result, the attacker is able to elevate their privileges in the default folder location.

## Business Impact:

This vulnerability can lead to reputational damage and indirect financial loss to the company through the impact to customersâ€™ trust. It could also result in privacy violations, fraud, or account takeover depending on the type of privilege escalation obtained by the attacker.

## Steps to Reproduce:

1. Use a browser to navigate to: {{URL}}
1. Notice that {{value}} is loaded by the application when doing {{action}}
1. Create binary file using {{software}}
1. Upload binary file using {{action}}
1. {{action}} to see permissions executed by the system
