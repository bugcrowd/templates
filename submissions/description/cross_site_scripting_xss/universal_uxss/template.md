# Universal Cross-Site Scripting

## Overview of the Vulnerability:

Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) is a type of injection attack where malicious JavaScript is injected into a website. When a user visits the affected web page, the Javascript executes within that user’s browser in the context of the domain. An instance of Universal XSS can be found on this domain, this allows an attacker to create a crafted URL, which when opened by a user, executes arbitrary Javascript within that user’s browser affecting any user session opened or cached in the browser.

From here, an attacker could carry out any actions that the user is able to perform in the context of the domain for this application, including accessing any of the user's data and modifying information within the user’s permissions. This can result in modification, deletion, or theft of data, including accessing or deleting files, or stealing session cookies which an attacker could use to hijack a user’s session.
  
## Business Impact:

XSS could lead to data theft through the attacker’s ability to manipulate data through their access to the application, and their ability to interact with other users, including performing other malicious attacks, which would appear to originate from a legitimate user. These malicious actions could also result in reputational damage for the business through the impact to customers’ trust.

## Steps to Reproduce:

1. Enable a HTTP interception proxy, such as Burp Suite or OWASP ZAP
1. Use a browser to navigate to: {{URL}}
1. Forward the following request to the endpoint:

```HTTP
{{request}}
```

1. Log into an account and navigate to URL which contains the payload
1. Observe the JavaScript payload being executed

## Proof of Concept (PoC):

Below is a screenshot demonstrating the injected JavaScript executing:
