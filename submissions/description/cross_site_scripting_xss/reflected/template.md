# Reflected XSS

## Overview

Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) is a type of injection attack where malicious scripts are injected into trusted websites. Once executed, this input is reflected in a userâ€™s browser without it being safely encoded. 

XSS in {{application}} of {{target}} allows an attacker to {{action}}

## Walkthrough & PoC

1. Navigate to {{url}}
1. Insert {{payload}} into {{parameter}} in {{url}}
1. Observe that the JavaScript payload was executed

## Vulnerability Evidence

The screenshot below demonstrates the injected JavaScript executing at {{url}}.

## Demonstrated Impact

XSS vulnerabilities allow a malicious attacker to gain access to a user's account and carry out any actions that the user is able to perform, including accessing any of the user's data. The attacker might be able to gain full control over all of the application's functionality and data depending on the user's level of permissions.

An attacker could abuse this XSS further to {{action}} by using the following JavaScript payload.

```javascript
{{payload}}
```
