# Reflected XSS (Self)

## Overview

<!--
Provide a 1-2 sentence description - see http://cveproject.github.io/docs/content/key-details-phrasing.pdf for tips

This format is a good guide:
[VULNTYPE] in [COMPONENT] in [APPLICATION] allows [ATTACKER] to [IMPACT] via [VECTOR] 
-->
Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) is a type of injection attack where malicious scripts are injected into trusted websites. XSS vulnerabilities allow a malicious attacker to gain access to a user's account and carry out any actions that the user is able to perform, including accessing any of the user's data. The attacker might be able to gain full control over all of the application's functionality and data depending on the user's level of permissions.

A self reflected XSS in {{application}} at {{url}} allows an attacker to {{action}} by adding or modifying JavaScript temporarily to their own account.

## Walkthrough & PoC

<!--
Provide a step-by-step walkthrough on how to access the vulnerable injection point, and how to exploit the vulnerability.
Adding a dot-pointed walkthrough with relevant screenshots will speed triage time and result in faster rewards!
-->

1. Log in to {{application}} at {{url}} using an existing account
1. Navigate to {{url}}
1. Observe the JavaScript payload that was executed

## Vulnerability Evidence

<!--
Your submission MUST include evidence of the vulnerability and not be theoretical in nature.

For a reflected XSS vulnerability, please include a simple URL or HTML payload that can be executed to easily demonstrate and reproduce the issue. 
-->

Below is a screenshot demonstrating the injected JavaScript executing at {{url}}.

## Demonstrated Impact

<!--
Attempt to escalate the XSS to perform additional actions (such as an account takeover or CSRF bypass to perform a sensitive action). If this is possible, provide a full proof-of-concept here.
--> 

A malicious attacker could abuse this XSS further to {{action}} by using the following JavaScript payload.

```
{{payload}}
```
