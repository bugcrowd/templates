# URL-Based Stored Cross-Site Scripting

## Overview of the Vulnerability:

Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) is a type of injection attack where malicious JavaScript is injected into a website. When a user visits the affected web page, the Javascript executes within that user’s browser in the context of this domain. Stored XSS that is based inside the URL can be found on this domain which allows an attacker to control code that is executed within a user’s browser.

From here, an attacker could carry out any actions that the user is able to perform, including accessing any of the user's data and modifying information within the user’s permissions. This can result in modification, deletion, or theft of data, including accessing or deleting files, or stealing session cookies which an attacker could use to hijack a user’s session.
  
## Business Impact:

Stored XSS could lead to data theft through the attacker’s ability to manipulate data through their access to the application, and their ability to interact with other users, including performing other malicious attacks, which would appear to originate from a legitimate user. These malicious actions could also result in reputational damage for the business through the impact to customers’ trust.

## Steps to Reproduce:

1. Enable a HTTP interception proxy, such as Burp Suite or OWASP ZAP
1. Use a browser to navigate to: {{URL}}
1. Forward the following request to the endpoint:

```HTTP
{{request}}
```

1. Log into an account and navigate to URL which contains the payload
1. Observe the JavaScript payload being executed

## Proof of Concept (PoC):

Below is a screenshot demonstrating the injected JavaScript executing:
