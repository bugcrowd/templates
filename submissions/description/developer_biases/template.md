Developer biases occurs when AI model developers' perspectives, assumptions, and decisions influence the behaviour and design of an the model. Biases stem from developer's background and experiences, and subconscious prejudices. Outputs from AI models that have a developer bias can result in skewed or otherwise unfair outcomes.

## Business Impact

Implicit bias in this AI model can result in unintended discrimination and unfairness which can lead to reputational damage and a loss of customer trust in the output of the model.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Provide the AI model with data containing subtle, implicit biases.
1. Observe the model's decisions and identify instances where it unintentionally favors certain groups or viewpoints.
