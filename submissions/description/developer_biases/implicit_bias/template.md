Implicit bias occurs when there are biases present within the training data of an AI model that affects its decision-making. These implicit biases are usually introduced into the AI model via the developers who affect the design, implementation, and deployment of the AI system.

**Business Impact**

Implicit bias in this AI model can result in unintended discrimination and unfairness which can lead to reputational damage and a loss of customer trust in the output of the model.

**Steps to Reproduce**

1. Provide the AI model with data containing subtle, implicit biases.
1. Observe the model's decisions and identify instances where it unintentionally favors certain groups or viewpoints.
