# Non-Sensitive Application Data Stored Unencrypted

## Overview of the Vulnerability:

Insecure data storage can occur in both the client and server sides of an application. Non-sensitive data from the application is stored unencrypted and is susceptible to being identified and used maliciously. An attacker with access to the unencrypted non-sensitive data can leverage the data to gather further information on users and the application, and use it to perform further attacks.

## Business Impact:

This vulnerability can lead to reputational damage and indirect financial loss to the company through the impact to customersâ€™ trust.

## Steps to Reproduce:

1. Login to the application and input data so that it is stored by the application
1. Navigate to where the application stores the gathered information
1. Navigate to {{url}}
1. Observe the application data that is stored unencrypted

## Proof of Concept (PoC):
