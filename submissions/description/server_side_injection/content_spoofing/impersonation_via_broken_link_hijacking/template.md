# Impersonation via Broken Link Hijacking

## Overview of the Vulnerability:

Content spoofing via Broken Link Hijacking is when a malicious attacker can register a link on behalf of the original owner due to a change in the original link. Due to the inherent trust a user has in the business and its brand, a malicious attacker is able to impersonate a credible target or domain to social engineer the user into disclosing data such as usernames, passwords or other sources of sensitive information.

## Business Impact:

This vulnerability can lead to reputational damage and indirect financial loss to the company through the impact to customersâ€™ trust.

## Steps to Reproduce:

1. Use a browser to navigate to: {{URL}}
1. Click on {{value}}
1. Observe that the link is redirected to an impersonate domain owned by the attacker
