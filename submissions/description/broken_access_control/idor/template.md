# Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)

## Overview of the Vulnerability

Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) occurs when there are no access control checks to verify if a request to interact with a resource is valid. An IDOR vulnerability within this application can be leveraged by an attacker to manipulate, destroy, or disclose data through their ability to bypass access controls and horizontally or vertically escalate their privileges. 

Given the type of IDOR within an application, an attacker could perform the following actions:
>
> - Gain unauthorized access to data from the application and retrieve privileged information
> - Perform unauthorized operations, such as escalating their privileges within the application, or forcing a password change on a user’s account in order to takeover that account
> - Manipulate internal application objects and elevate their privileges, alter data, or gain access to and manipulate the application’s APIs
> - Gain direct access to files and manipulate the file system, such as uploading, downloading, adding, or deleting data, including other user’s data.
>

## Business Impact:

IDOR can lead to indirect financial loss through an attacker accessing, deleting, or modifying data from within the application. This could also result in reputational damage for the business through the impact to customers’ trust. The severity of the impact to the business is dependent on the sensitivity of the data being stored in, and transmitted by, the application.

## Steps to Reproduce:

1. Use a browser to navigate to the URL: {{URL}}
1. Login to User Account A
1. In the URL bar, modify the parameter to a different value:

{{eg.<https://example.com/parameter(UserAccountB)>}}

1. Observe that the application displays information of User Account B, as seen in the screenshot(s) below:
