# Edit/Delete Sensitive Information/Iterable Object Identifiers

## Overview of the Vulnerability

Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) occurs when there are no access control checks to verify if a request to interact with a resource is valid. An IDOR vulnerability within this application allows an attacker to alter sensitive information by iterating through object identifiers.

## Business Impact

IDOR can lead to reputational damage for the business through the impact to customersâ€™ trust. The severity of the impact to the business is dependent on the sensitivity of the data being stored in, and transmitted by the application.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Use a browser to navigate to: {{URL}}
1. Login to User Account A
1. In the URL bar, modify the parameter to a different value:
>
> {{eg.<https://example.com/parameter(UserAccountB)>}}

1. Observe that the application displays information of User Account B, as seen in the screenshot below:

## Proof of Concept (PoC)

Below is a screenshot demonstrating the exposed object executing:

A malicious attacker could leverage this IDOR vulnerability to read data by using the following payload:  
  
``` bash
{{payload}}
```
