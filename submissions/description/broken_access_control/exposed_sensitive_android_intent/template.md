# Exposed Sensitive Android Intent

## Overview of the Vulnerability:

An `Intent` is a messaging object used within an Android application to request action from a different component of the application. When a request occurs and information is retrieved, a lack of validation can result in access controls being bypassed and sensitive information being leaked.
The application has an exposed sensitive Android `Intent` which an attacker can query to gather sensitive information from the application which they could use to perform further attacks on the application, the business, or its users.

## Business Impact:

This vulnerability can lead to reputational damage and indirect financial loss to the company through the impact to customersâ€™ trust. The severity of the impact to the business is dependent on the sensitivity of the accessible data being transmitted by the application.

## Steps to Reproduce:

1. Enable a HTTP interception proxy, such as Burp Suite or OWASP ZAP
1. Use a browser to navigate to: {{URL}}
1. Login to an account that should not be able to perform {{action}}
1. Forward the following request to the endpoint:

```HTTP
{{request}}
```

1. Observe that the account now has additional user functionality and access to data it was previously not authorized to access

## Proof of Concept (PoC):
