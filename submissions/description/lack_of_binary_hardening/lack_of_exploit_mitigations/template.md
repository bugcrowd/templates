# Lack of Exploit Mitigations

## Overview of the Vulnerability:

A lack of exploit mitigations in an application increases its attack surface and leaves it open to code analysis, reverse engineering, or modification of the application. An attacker could abuse the lack of exploit mitigations in order to run known exploits on the application. From here, the attacker can access sensitive data stored, transmitted or processed by the application and perform further attacks on the application, the business, or its users.

## Business Impact:

This vulnerability can lead to indirect financial loss to the company due to data theft, application manipulation and corruption, or denial of service to customers and users of the application. It can also lead to reputational damage as customers may view the application as insecure.

## Steps to Reproduce:

1. Navigate to the source code files of the application
1. Run the following known exploit: {{payload}}
1. Observe that the application does not contain any mitigations to prevent this exploit

## Proof of Concept (PoC):
