Aggregation bias occurs in an AI model when systematic favoritism is displayed when processing data from different demographic groups. This bias originates from training data that is skewed, or that has an under representation of certain groups. Outputs from AI models that have an aggregation bias can result in unequal treatment of users based on demographic characteristics, which can lead to unfair and discriminatory outcomes.

#### Business Impact

Aggregation bias in this AI model can result in reputational damage and indirect financial loss due to the loss of customer trust in the output of the model.

#### Steps to Reproduce

1. Obtain a diverse dataset containing demographic information
1. Feed the dataset into the AI model
1. Record the model's predictions and decisions
1. Compare outcomes across different demographic groups
1. Observe the systematic favoritism displayed by the model toward one or more specific groups
