# Small Seed Space in Pseudo-Random Number Generator (PRNG)

## Overview of the Vulnerability

A Pseudo-Random Number Generator (PRNG) uses an initial seed value to generate random number through a complex algorithm. When this seed value is small in size, it is possible to bruteforce all possible seeed values. An attacker who can guess the seed value can predict or guess the random numbers generated by the PRNG. This can lead to unauthorized access if that seed value is used for authorization and authentication.

## Business Impact

This vulnerability can lead to reputational damage of the company through the impact to customers’ trust, and the ability of an attacker to view data. The severity of the impact to the business is dependent on the sensitivity of the accessible data being transmitted by the application.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Enable a HTTP interception proxy, such as Burp Suite or OWASP ZAP
1. Setup {{software}} to intercept and log requests
1. Use a browser to navigate to: {{URL}}
1. {{action}} to view unencrypted requests
