# Predictable Initialization Vector (IV)

## Overview of the Vulnerability:

Cryptographic algorithms use an initial block of data (called an initialization vector) alongside the plaintext data that is encrypted. When this IV is predictable, an attacker can identify the IV from the original data within the encryption.

## Business Impact:

This vulnerability can lead to reputational damage of the company through the impact to customersâ€™ trust, and the ability of an attacker to view data. The severity of the impact to the business is dependent on the sensitivity of the accessible data being transmitted by the application.

## Steps to Reproduce:

1. Enable a HTTP interception proxy, such as Burp Suite or OWASP ZAP
1. Setup {{software}} to intercept and log requests
1. Use a browser to navigate to: {{URL}}
1. {{action}} to view unencrypted requests

## Proof of Concept (PoC):

The screenshot below demonstrates the predictability of the initialization vector:
