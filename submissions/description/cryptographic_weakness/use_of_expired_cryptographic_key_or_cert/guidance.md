# Guidance

Provide a step-by-step walkthrough with a screenshot on how you exploited the vulnerability. This will speed triage time and result in faster rewards. Please include specific details on where you identified the expired cryptographic key or certificate, how you identified it, and what actions you were able to perform as a result.

Attempt to escalate the vulnerability to perform additional actions. If this is possible, provide a full Proof of Concept (PoC).
