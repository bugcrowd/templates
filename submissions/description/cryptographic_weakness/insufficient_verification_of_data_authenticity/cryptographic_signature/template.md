# Cryptographic Signature

## Overview of the Vulnerability:

Cryptography is used to ensure secure storage and transmission of data. However, there are a number of best practices that must be followed to ensure the cryptography in use remains secure and does not result in the exposure of sensitive data. It was identified that the application fails to verify the cryptographic signature. Ths can allow an attacker to break the confidentiality and integrity of requests sent to and from the endpoint.

## Business Impact:

This vulnerability can lead to reputational damage of the company through the impact to customersâ€™ trust, and the ability of an attacker to view data. The severity of the impact to the business is dependent on the sensitivity of the accessible data being transmitted by the application.

## Steps to Reproduce:

1. Enable a HTTP interception proxy, such as Burp Suite or OWASP ZAP
1. Setup {{software}} to intercept and log requests
1. Use a browser to navigate to: {{URL}}
1. {{action}} to view unencrypted requests

## Proof of Concept (PoC):

The screenshot below demonstrates the insufficient validation of the cryptographic signature:
