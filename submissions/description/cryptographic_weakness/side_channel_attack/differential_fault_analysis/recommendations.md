# Recommendation(s)

Implement robust entropy for the cryptographic algorithms and ensure that the algorithms, protocols, and keys in place are kept up to date. The application and its systems should always revert to a known and uniform state when faults and errors occur. This can be achieved through uniform exception handling, restoring saved states, or system reset. The exact method will be contextual to the application.
