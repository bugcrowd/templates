This vulnerability stems from an inherent design flaw within the IPMI v2.0 specification itself, and as such there is no patch for remediation. However, strong and unique passwords can be implemented to limit the likelihood of success for off-line dictionary attacks against retrieved hashes. Further mitigations may include implementing access controls or network-level isolation to limit access to IPMI management interfaces.
