Disable anonymous login on FTP if it is not required. 

In the event anonymous logins are required as part of a legitimate business need, compensating controls such as IP allow listing should be put in place to mitigate the risk of truly anonymous connections. Regularly audit the contents of the service and file system permissions to prevent inadvertent exposure of sensitive data.
