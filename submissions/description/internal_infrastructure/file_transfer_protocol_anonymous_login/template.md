A File Transfer Protocol (FTP) server running on the remote host allows anonymous logins. 

Any individual with remote connectivity to the service may gain access to the server without providing a password or unique credentials. 

This would permit an anonymous attacker to access any files made available by the FTP server within the folder to which the anonymous account has permission to view, potentially exposing sensitive material.

**Business Risk**

This vulnerability could lead to unauthorised access and data theft. The severity of the impact to the business is dependent on the sensitivity of the data exposed by the service.
