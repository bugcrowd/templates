The SSH (Secure Shell) server supported key-exchange, host-key, encryption, or message authentication code (MAC) algorithms that are considered insecure. 

The use of these weak algorithms makes SSH communication vulnerable to various cryptographic attacks, potentially allowing attackers to decrypt sensitive data or tamper with communications.

**Business Risk**
