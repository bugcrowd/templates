Disable the "None" authentication method on the VNC servers. Configure VNC servers to enforce strong authentication, ideally using a robust password or, where supported and feasible, integrate with existing authentication mechanisms like user accounts or multi-factor authentication. Restrict VNC access to authorized personnel and specific IP addresses or subnets through firewall rules and network segmentation. Regularly update VNC server software to the latest patched version to address any known vulnerabilities.
