Disable password-based authentication for SSH and enforce the use of public-key authentication. Disable direct root login via SSH; instead, use a non-privileged user and then sudo to root if necessary. Furthermore, consider setting a strong password on the authentication keys and the use of multi-factor authentication where possible.
